#### My pronouns are he/they.

I am a <!-- break up titles/company to make version controlling easier -->

I have been building things with WordPress for over
15 years

20 years.

I also [write](https://jazzsequence.com/articles/) and play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game" title="tabletop role playing games">TTRPGs</a> and create [homebrew content](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/user/jazzsequence) for Dungeons & Dragons that you can also [support on DMsGuild](https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=Chris%20Reynolds). You can find more fiction and game design work on my [blog](https://jazzsequence.com).

I am 1/3 of the podcast [Binary Jazz](https://binaryjazz.com) -- we write [code](https://github.com/BinaryJazz), too.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m primarily a PHP developer but I'm always looking to learn and practise more JavaScript and React
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in collaborating with other TTRPG content creators on games and D&D (or other TTRPG) content
- ðŸ“« You can find me in a lot of [places](https://jazzsequence.github.io) but I'm probably most active socially on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jazzs3quence), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jazzs3quence) and Discord (`jazzsequence#0393`).

### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris, [jazzsequence](https://jazzsequence.com) on the internet.

#### My pronouns are he/they.

I am a <!-- break up titles/company to make version controlling easier -->
Developer Advocate
at [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io)

I have been building things with WordPress for over
18 years
and making things on the internet for over
25 years.

I also [write](https://jazzsequence.com/articles/) and play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game" title="tabletop role playing games">TTRPGs</a> and create [homebrew content](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/user/jazzsequence) for Dungeons & Dragons that you can also [support on DMsGuild](https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=Chris%20Reynolds). You can find more fiction and game design work on my [blog](https://jazzsequence.com). Currently, I'm writing my first novel.

I'm casually interested in AI and LLMs and have been writing about my experiments on [my blog](https://jazzsequence.com/series/artificial-intelligence/).

I am 1/3 of the podcast [Binary Jazz](https://binaryjazz.com) -- we write [code](https://github.com/BinaryJazz), too.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m primarily a PHP developer but I'm always looking to learn and practise more JavaScript and React.
- ðŸ’» Recently, I've been writing a lot of server-side scripts and CI automations and really enjoy writing new GitHub Actions. You can checkout my [Brewfile profile](https://www.brewfiles.com/brew/KLMTzN28kH3Ym4chgPvw/) on [brewfiles.com](https://brewfiles.com).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in collaborating with other TTRPG content creators on games and D&D (or other TTRPG) content.
- ðŸ“« You can find me in a lot of [places](https://jazzsequence.github.io) but I'm probably most active socially on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jazzs3quence), [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@jazzs3quence), [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@jazzsequence), and Discord (`@jazzsequence`).

Over the years, I've written a lot of WordPress plugins and themes for personal projects, freelance projects and professional projects. Some of these are still actively maintained while some have fallen into history.
